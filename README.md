# Markdown Patch

Markdown Patch is a patch format and tool that allows you to make
systematic changes to Markdown documents by allowing you to
alter the content of a Markdown document relative to elements
of that document's structure like headings or block references.

Have you ever needed to set up a script for modifying a markdown document and found yourself using arcane tools like `sed` before giving up entirely?  This tool might be for you!
